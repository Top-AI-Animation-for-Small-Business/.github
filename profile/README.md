## Why Small Businesses Need AI Animation Tools  

Small businesses face unique challenges: limited budgets, small teams, and the constant pressure to compete with bigger brands. Video marketing, however, is non-negotiable. Studies show that 86% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, and viewers retain 95% of a message when it’s delivered via video compared to just 10% through text. Animation takes this a step further by offering versatility—think eye-catching ads, animated logos, or storytelling shorts—without the need for actors, cameras, or expensive editing suites.  

AI animation tools simplify the process by automating complex tasks like scene creation, character design, and voiceovers. For small businesses, this means professional results without hiring a video production team. But with so many options out there, how do you choose the **top AI animation tool for small business**? Let’s break it down, starting with our #1 pick: MovieReelAI.
